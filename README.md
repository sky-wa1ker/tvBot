# tvBot
tvBot is a discord bot that uses TMDb API and allows you to search for and fetch info about movies, tv shows, actors right from your discord servers.

<b>I am not working on it anymore.</b>

### What to do with the code?
If you are an experienced python programmer then there's really nothing for you here, it is all beginner level code as it is my first ever program. But if you are also new to this like me, feel free to use it however you want.

#### How to test the code yourself?
1. Install necessary dependencies, you'll need [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/).
   
   - To install requests, use this command in command prompt - ```pip install requests```
   - To install discord.py - ```pip install discord.py```
   - If you bump into an error, see [this](https://appuals.com/fix-pip-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/) page.

2. Fork and clone this repository or just download (prefer this) it into your computer.

3. Make an account and get an API key from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

4. Create your bot on discord, get its 'token' and invite in into your test server. Click [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#creating-a-bot-account) for help.

5. Create a text file name 'token_key.txt' in the same folder where 'main<span>.py' is, and copy paste your bot token in first line and your TMDb API key in second line and save the file. (the order is important.)

6. That's it, you're good to go. I'm reachable on discord as Sam Cooper#9490.
