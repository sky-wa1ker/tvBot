# tvBot
tvBot is a discord bot that uses TMDb API and allows you to search for and fetch info about movies, tv shows, actors right from your discord servers.

It is a work in progress as of now.

### What to do with the code?
If you are an experienced python programmer then there's really nothing for you here, it is all beginner level code as it is my first ever program. But if you are also new to this like me, feel free to use it for educational purposes.

#### How to test the code yourself?
1. Install necessary dependencies, you'd need [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/).

2. Fork and clone this repository or just download (prefer this) it into your computer.

3. Make an account and get an API key from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

4. Create your bot on discord, get its 'token' and invite in into your test server. Click [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#creating-a-bot-account) for help.

5. Create a text file name 'token_key.txt' in the same folder where 'main<span>.py' is, and copy paste your bot token in first line and your TMDb API key in second line and save the file. (the order is important.)

6. That's it, you're good to go. I'm reachable on discord as Sam Cooper#9490
